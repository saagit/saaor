INSTRUCTIONS:

* Cut the salmon fillet to get 2-3 inch wide chunks with each
  chunk having roughly a uniform thickness.
* Put the marinade and the salmon chunks in a plastic bag, squeeze
  the air out, and seal it.
* Put the bag in a container to contain any possible leaks and
  refrigerate for at least 12 hours.
* Place empty flavor pan in smoker.
* Remove drip pan and racks from smoker.
* Completely cover drip pan with foil and spray smoker racks with
  cooking spray.
* Remove the salmon chunks from the marinade, pat them dry with paper
  towels and put them on the racks with all the chunks on a rack
  having similar thickness.
* Plug in the smoker to preheat.
* Allow the salmon to air dry for approximately 30 minutes.  The
  surface should be dull and no longer look wet.
* Once the salmon has air dried and the smoker is preheated, place
  the drip pan into the smoker.
* Place the loaded racks in the smoker arranging them so the
  thickest pieces of salmon are at the bottom of the smoker and
  thinnest at the top.
* Remove the flavor pan from the smoker, fill it with alder wood
  chips and replace it in the smoker.  Close the smoker and start
  a timer to track the running time for the whole process.
* 1 hour later, dump the ashes from the flavor pan and replace it
  in the smoker after refilling it with alder chips.
* 1 hour later, dump the ashes from the flavor pan and replace it
  in the smoker after filling it with apple chips.
* 1 hour later, dump the ashes from the flavor pan and replace it
  in the smoker leaving it empty.
* 50 minutes later, preheat the oven to 250°F.
* 10 minutes later, remove the salmon from the smoker and put in
  the oven for 30 minutes to produce a firmer, dryer texture.
* Cool salmon to room temperature.
* Wrap each piece of salmon separately in plastic wrap.
* Keep salmon refrigerated.
